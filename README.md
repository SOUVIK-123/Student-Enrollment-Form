# Title of the Project
Student Enrollment Form using JsonPowerDB

# Description

This project  is a basic HTML form for adding student details such as ID, name, class, birthdate, address, and enrollment date. It also includes JavaScript code for form validation and sending data to JsonPowerDB, which is a NoSQL database that uses a simple JSON-based syntax for data storage and retrieval.

The code defines several functions for handling form input and creating a PUT request to save data to the JsonPowerDB. The validateAndGetFormData function ensures that all required form fields are filled before sending data to the database. The createPUTRequest function creates a PUT request using the JsonPowerDB API endpoint URL and the JSON object containing the student data. The executeCommand function sends the PUT request to the JsonPowerDB and returns the result as a JSON object.
